# circe-zstream

This is a port of circe-fs2, replacing the fs2 dependency with zstream.  Method names from the upstream project have been preserved here and the test suite has - for the most part - been, likewise, reproduced.

This project came to being as I was getting started with the zio ecosystem on a project and wanted to get a better idea of how the zstream module compared with fs2.
